// btw setting sky on request is easy. you just do element.setAttribute("src or idk what", "some url")
// and you do it in some function, no need for a-frame components

// oh, didn't read this to the end

// I did it. See those 2 spheres to the left and right? if you hover over them, the background changes. 
// Still have to connect the camera though, and think of a better place for them.


// haha, funny that street
// but isnt it wierd to have those sphere? maybe new random background should be generated anew for each game..

// i thought to have some small button or something at top right corner of page that enables user to change video to pic and reverse

// sounds good, but I have to go get some sleep or I'll be a zombie at work tomorrow

// sure
// good work today!! i like how invaders seem to walk like zombies towards you


// also i had idea, to place small sphere behing player and aliens would come only from one side => thy try to conquer the earth, but player is in the way and is defending the earth!
// sphere that looks lik earth, you know

// I like it
// yup, I like it

// also, we should find a more efficent way to communicate. This is cool, but very inefficient :D

// ok, going to bed. Awesome stuff, man! Good night!

// good night



M:
// that super street on earth should be second level! "while you were defending our beloved planet, they invaded it behind your back...
// now you must fight against them in streets of Sicily"
// 3rd level environment? your room at the moment!

// in space we can have other planets orbiting around as well... just as realistic background, those kids are smart.. :)


or those yellow and red planets could actually be 'Black holes' and serve as teleports to other spots where you have to fight too!!

This is a nifty idea and we can evolve forever almost. Let's implement your ever-closer idea with space, Sicily, and player's current location. After that, we send it to coder dojo and then we can do anything we want, but we need a limit so we can deliver.
