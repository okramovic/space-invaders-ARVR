## Welcome to the Space Invaders AR
#### This time they came for real... Use your smartphone to [save the Earth](https://spokevr.glitch.me/)


Project started at [Coder Dojo Vienna Hackathon](https://www.eventbrite.de/e/coderdojo-wien-hackathon-at-microsoft-tickets-41918976788) by [Marko Bogdanovic](https://github.com/okramovic) and [Vlad Petrea](https://github.com/furtunadincarpati)

Our aim was to come up with fun project for CoderDojo children that would encourage them to learn developing Virtual Reality games using very good open-source webVR library [A-frame](https://aframe.io/).
We hacked it a bit to be able to fake Augmented Reality app.
